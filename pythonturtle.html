    <p>Today I actively used the Python programming language for the first time.<br>
    Compared to Scratch, Python is less visual and more typing since it doesn't have blocks. It also has a lot of syntax and conventions to follow.<br>
    One thing I really like about Python is that it's more efficient and sometimes more straightforward than Scratch. I haven't had any glitches so far.<br>
    We basically did the same shape drawing game that we made on Scratch, but it was somehow more logical and satisfying to do it in Python.</p>
